## Introduction

Learning data structures and algorithms is essential for any programmer or software engineer. This repository aims to help you understand DSA concepts by providing Java code implementations. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer wanting to refresh your knowledge, this repository is a valuable resource.

## Data Structures

In this repository, you will find Java implementations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each data structure is organized in its own folder with code, explanations, and usage examples.

## Algorithms

We also cover a wide range of algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- And many more!

The code for each algorithm is available in its respective folder with explanations and sample inputs/outputs.

## Getting Started
